        <p>>It is important to clarify that they do not explain the origin of the universe and communities (myths) 
rather they pick on the specific trend or<br> aspect of life and explain its origin. They may explain physical 
attributes of animals and nature and trace the origin of present relationships.</p>  
        <p>Examples – why the hyena limps, why the hare has a short tail, why the zebra has stripes,<br> how the dog 
became a domestic animal, why women do not own animals, how the hawk and the hen became 
perpetual enemies.</p>

      <h3>2. Trickster Narrative</h3>
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Trickster narrative image">
      <p>The stories involve trickery where one character, the tricksters, uses his wit to undo another dupe. The 
trickster is presented as a wise<br> and cunning character while the dupe is usually foolish and gullible.  
<br>Each community tends to have its tricksters and dupes.</p>
      <p> Common tricksters include the hare, the squirrel, 
Chameleon, tortoise, spider, and monkey etc. The most common dupe is the hyena.<br> There is a trend 
where smaller and weaker animals seem to outdo the stronger and the bigger ones.</p>

      <h3>3. Ogre Narratives</h3>
      <p> Ogres are characters that are half human and half animal. They are super to change from human 
characters that have the ability to change<br> from human beings to animals. They feed on human beings 
and have the ability to devour everything that comes to sight.</br></p>
      <P> In many of the stories, they appear in 
human gatherings as perfect human being for example, <br>very handsome young men but late they old turn 
to ugly man-eating creatures.</br></p>
      <p>Ogres are an embodiment of evil that successfully camouflages as good among human beings only to 
reveal itself later.<br> Ogre stories serve to caution human beings to be careful and on the lookout for evil 
that could be camouflaged around us.<br> Children were especially warned against strangers.</br> </p>
